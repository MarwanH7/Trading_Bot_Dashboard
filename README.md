# Trading_Bot_Dashboard

## Overview

The Trading_Bot_Dashboard project aims to build a real-time dashboard for predicting and visualizing Bitcoin price movements using advanced machine learning and time series forecasting techniques. This dashboard will help traders and analysts make informed decisions by identifying potential range extremes, deviations, and breakouts with probabilistic predictions.

## Business Value

- **Real-Time Analysis**: Provides up-to-date insights into Bitcoin price movements, allowing for timely trading decisions.
- **Probabilistic Predictions**: Offers a statistical basis for identifying potential market turning points, enhancing decision-making and risk management.
- **Automation**: Reduces manual analysis by automating the detection of price patterns and predictions, increasing efficiency.

## Technical Value

- **Integration of Advanced Models**: Utilizes ARIMA, XGBoost, and Deep Learning models for robust time series forecasting and classification.
- **Scalable Data Pipelines**: Implements scalable data pipelines to handle real-time data ingestion, processing, and storage.
- **MLOps Best Practices**: Follows MLOps principles for model deployment, monitoring, and continuous improvement.

## Project Structure

### Data Collection and Processing

Following the [DataTalksClub Data Engineering Zoomcamp](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp) course, this project will implement data pipelines to collect and process historical and real-time Bitcoin price data.

- **Data Ingestion**: Collects data from Financial Modeling Prep (FMP) API.
- **Data Storage**: Stores data in a suitable format for further analysis.
- **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: Handles missing values, normalization, and feature engineering.

### Model Training and Deployment

Based on the [DataTalksClub MLOps Zoomcamp](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/mlops-zoomcamp) course, this project will train and deploy machine learning models to the dashboard.

- **Model Training**: Trains ARIMA, XGBoost, and Deep Learning models on historical data.
- **Model Evaluation**: Validates model performance and fine-tunes hyperparameters.
- **Model Deployment**: Deploys models to a production environment for real-time predictions.

### Dashboard Development

- **Real-Time Predictions**: Integrates real-time data fetching with model predictions.
- **Visualization**: Develops interactive visualizations to display price movements and probabilistic predictions.
- **User Interface**: Ensures the dashboard is user-friendly and provides actionable insights.
